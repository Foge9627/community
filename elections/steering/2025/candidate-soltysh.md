## What I have done

I've been an active Kubernetes contributor since late 2014, with the majority of
my work focused on SIG CLI and SIG Apps.

My contributions to SIG CLI range from major refactors like
[moving kubectl to staging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1020)
and extracting [helpers for creating kubectl-like commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/cli-runtime),
to standardizing the shape of every command. I've also led significant features,
such as [introducing the current kubectl plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2379),
and, more recently [separating kubectl user preferences](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3104).
Currently, I'm focused on the technical oversight of SIG CLI, ensuring our work
moves steadily forward.

In SIG Apps, I was nominated as a lead in early 2021 in recognition of my long-time
contributions to Kubernetes controllers, including authoring
[Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/apps/job.md)
and [CronJobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/apps/cronjob.md).
Over the past few years we've focused on expanding batch and workload controllers
with new capabilities while improving their performance and stability.

As an early contributor to the Kubernetes project, I've had the opportunity to
work in areas beyond these SIGs. Over the years, I wrote the
[first version of audit logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/27087),
later helped shape [the current mechanism](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/22),
and have made various contributions across the API server.

Finally, during my past two years on the Steering Committee, I have worked with
multiple contributors and groups (SIGs, WGs, sub-projects), often privately,
to provide them with the support necessary to achieve their goals within our project.

## What I'll do

My number one priority remains ensuring our contributors and maintainers have the
support they need to thrive. Whether through mentoring new contributors or rotating
existing roles, we must ensure Kubernetes has both the people and the resources it
needs to grow. By investing in our people, we equip the Kubernetes project to continue
supporting the entire world with the best possible platform for managing modern
applications.
